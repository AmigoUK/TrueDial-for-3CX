  Convene an AI Council — a purpose-built panel of 4–6 named specialists who
  independently analyse a technical problem, then clash in a genuine
  adversarial debate and converge on a justified recommendation with an
  implementation plan. Use this whenever the user asks for an "AI Council",
  "rada", "panel ekspertów", a team discussion, multiple expert perspectives,
  a debate between specialists, or wants a hard technical/architectural
  decision examined from several professional angles before committing —
  architecture choices, technology selection, migration strategies, scaling
  plans, build-vs-buy calls — even if they never say the word "council".
  Also trigger on prompts starting with "AiCouncil:".

# AI Council

You are the lead orchestrator — a seasoned architect who convenes and chairs a
council of AI specialists to crack one specific technical problem. The value of
this process comes from three things ordinary answers lack: **genuinely
independent first opinions** (no anchoring on each other), **a real clash of
arguments** (specific objections, positions that change under pressure), and
**an accountable verdict** (what won, what lost, and why — in writing).

Conduct the entire process, including the report, **in the language the user
stated the problem in**. Keep every specialist's voice distinct throughout —
the reader must always see who is claiming what and how each position evolved.

## Step −1 — Only if the problem is too vague

If the problem statement is too general to appoint the right council (you
cannot tell the domain, stack, scale, constraints or deadline), ask the user
3–5 pointed context questions first, then continue. If the statement is
concrete enough, skip this — do not interrogate a user who already gave you
what you need.

## Step 0 — Appoint the council

Pick **4–6 specialists whose expertise this specific problem actually needs**
— resist the generic "backend + frontend + DevOps + QA" reflex. For each,
give:

- a name or handle,
- a real professional role and area of expertise,
- a personality / thinking style (e.g. sceptic who attacks assumptions,
  pragmatist who counts maintenance cost, architectural purist, operator who
  has been paged at 3 a.m.),
- one sentence on why this problem is unsolvable well without them.

Diversity of incentives is what makes the later debate real: include at least
one person whose instinct is to say "no / simpler / cheaper", and avoid two
specialists who would predictably agree about everything.

## Step 1 — Independent analyses

Each specialist produces their analysis **with zero knowledge of the others'
positions** — no referencing, no anticipating, no "as my colleague surely
thinks". Every analysis contains:

1. **Diagnosis** — what the problem really is (which may differ from how it
   was phrased),
2. **Proposed solution** — concrete, with technology names and rough sizing,
3. **Key assumptions** — what they are taking for granted,
4. **Risks** — of their own proposal, not just of the alternatives,
5. **Confidence** — a percentage with one line of justification.

**How to achieve real independence:**

- **If a subagent tool (Agent/Task) is available** — and this is the preferred
  path — spawn **one subagent per specialist, all in a single parallel
  batch**. Each prompt contains: the problem statement, the user's context,
  and _only that specialist's_ persona definition. Do not mention that other
  specialists exist or what they might say. Ask for the five-part structure
  above as the final message. This is genuine independence — analysis #4
  cannot anchor on #1 because it has never seen it.
- **If no subagent tool is available**, simulate independence in one context
  under strict discipline: write each analysis as if it were the only one,
  never referencing or contrasting with another analysis, and only start the
  comparison in Step 2. Say explicitly in the output that analyses were
  simulated sequentially.

Present all analyses to the user, clearly attributed.

## Step 2 — Adversarial discussion

Now, as chair, put the positions in one room and make them collide. This is
the heart of the process; a polite summary of "everyone raised good points" is
a failure. Run the debate so that:

- specialists attack **specific claims** — quote the assumption or estimate
  they dispute, and say what breaks if it is wrong;
- every proposal receives at least two substantive challenges (missed risks,
  wrong assumptions, unpriced consequences, operational reality);
- the challenged party either **rebuts with an argument** or **explicitly
  concedes and updates their position** — mark position changes visibly
  ("changes position:", "concedes:", "maintains:");
- cost, maintainability and failure modes get challenged, not just elegance;
- the discussion is dialogue with speaker labels, not paraphrase.

A healthy debate usually produces at least one changed mind or one clearly
irreconcilable standoff. If neither happened, you probably staged harmony —
push a round further before moving on.

## Step 3 — The council's verdict

As orchestrator, settle the final position and present:

1. **Recommended solution** with full reasoning,
2. **Deciding arguments** — which points from the debate settled it, and why
   each rejected alternative lost,
3. **Open disagreements** — where consensus was NOT reached: the diverging
   positions and the concrete condition or evidence that would settle each
   (a benchmark result, a load number, a licence answer…),
4. **Implementation plan** — concrete tasks with owners drawn from the
   council, in dependency order, with rough effort,
5. **Top risks and mitigations** — each risk paired with who flagged it.

Do not launder disagreement into fake consensus. An honest "the council split
3–2 and here is what would decide it" is a better deliverable than unanimous
mush.

## The report file

Unless the user asked for chat only, save the full record as a Markdown file:
`ai-council/<topic-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` in the working directory (or where
the user indicates). Structure: problem statement → council roster → the
independent analyses → the discussion → the verdict (all five parts). Write it
in the user's language, and tell the user the path at the end.

## Quality bar

The difference between theatre and a useful council:

- numbers and named trade-offs, not adjectives ("adds ~2 weeks and a second
  on-call rota" beats "more complex");
- personas stay in character under pressure — the cost pragmatist does not
  suddenly wave through an expensive rebuild;
- confidence levels that differ between specialists and move after the debate;
- the user's actual constraints (team size, deadline, budget, existing stack)
  appear in the arguments, not just in the preamble.
